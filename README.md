## Hi there Folks ðŸ‘‹
<p align="center">
My name is <b> David Fauzi </b>, you can call me David. Currently i'm a final year student in Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) majoring in Electrical Engineering.
</p>
<br/>

In my major, i learnt a lot about how computer works starting from the lowest abstraction level such as transistor, electronic circuit, logic gate, into low level stuff such as computer architecture, register, assembly, embedded, into a higher level languange. That knowledge really makes me appreciate the effort given for developing IT infrastructure and the limitless potential of software engineering.
